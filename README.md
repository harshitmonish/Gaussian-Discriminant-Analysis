# Project Title:

## Implement GDA for seperating out salmons from Alaska and Canada.

* Each salmon is represented by two attributes x1 and x2 depicting growth ring diameters in 1) fresh water, 2) marine water, respectively. 
* File "q4x.dat" stores the two attribute values with one entry on each row. File "q4y.dat" contains the target values (y(i)'s belongs to  {Alaska, Canada} on respective rows.
* Assume that both the classes have the same co-variance matrix, implemented GDA using closed form equation and reported the values of mu0, mu1 and cov matrix.
* Plotted the training data corresponding to the two coordinates of the input features, and used a different symbol for each point plotted to indicate whether that example had label Canada or Alaska.
* Implemented GDA in the general setting where each of the target classes have its own covariance matrix. This results in quadratic decision boundary seperating the two class region. Reported the values of mu0, mu1, cov matrix0, cov matrix 1.
* Plotted the quadratic decision boundary obtained.
